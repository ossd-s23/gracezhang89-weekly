# Open Source Within Industry Reflection

During our class period, we discussed the different ways open source software can be intertwined with business. I was interested to learn about how RedHat popularized this particular business model and all the different companies that use open source in some way.

# Group Project Reflection

Our group project work has been going well and the tickets we have been able to work on are successfully merged. I have been happy with the features we have been able to work on and I believe the continuous accepted commits are our group's biggest accomplishments. As we mentioned previously, we were pleasently surprised at how immediately accepting MAPLE was of our outreach. We were quickly staffed on a project and furthermore, for each ticket we commented on they told us to go for it. I was a bit surprised that MAPLE allows for self-assignment of issues but upon further reflection, that made sense given the launch may cause more urgency to finish.
