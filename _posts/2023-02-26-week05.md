# Discussion with Mek

The discussion with Mek from the Internet Archive was quite fascinating. I enjoyed hearing his presentation, from why he decided to join to the technology stack the non-profit likes to use. I would be interested in contributing to the Open Library, especially in the creation of smaller new features that he mentioned or adding to the front-end design.

# My Contributions

So far, I have made one contribution to the course website and have requested to claim another. This is my first course where students are allowed to modify the course website or implement changes to existing learning materials, which is quite interesting. The first contribution I made was a naming change to one of the team's extensions given they changed the extension idea during the work period. The biggest challenge for me was to ensure that the process of claiming and fulfilling a contribution was done correctly. When working with others, especially when there is a set process, I want to make sure I am following what is asked of me. I enjoyed making the contribution and will continue doing so when I see issues I would like to tackle.
