# Group Project Reflection

This week my group has been working on wrapping up our existing issues and communicating to the team that our semester is coming to an end. We have also been compiling our final presentation. Along the way, I realized how much we actually got to contribute to MAPLE and I am happy we have met our goals. I think it is especially satisfying to see our pull requests be merged to production so that code I have written reflects on the actual website.
