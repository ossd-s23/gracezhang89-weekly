# Group Work Reflection

In the past few weeks, my group has been able to get on a call with the team lead of MAPLE to discuss possible points of contribution. He first asked us to help create a flyer, which we agreed to as a way to ease into the platform. We are in the process of being assigned issues and have been added to their repository as collaborators. So far, I am pretty pleased with our project choice because we have been able to have clear communication with the leaders and they are very friendly and eager to help us get started.

# Invited Talk Reflection
The talk with Jim Hall this past week was quite interesting. He was clearly very passionate about the space, which made the conversation more enjoyable. I specifically liked how he talked about his personal journey and appreciated that he answered my question about the responsibilities. of a maintainer.
