# Weekly Reflection

This week was a continuation of our project work. My group is working specifically on an issue tackling displaying lobbying data for specific bills. We are connecting with the design and front-end team to learn exactly how they would like this to be implemented and how much ownership over the feature we will have. We recently got access to Figma and are waiting on a snapshot of the SQL database. Overall, we are quite excited to be working on this issue and look forward to actually getting into the project.
