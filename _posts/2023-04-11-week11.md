# Cathedral and the Bazaar Reflection

The discussion during class was intriguing and I enjoyed hearing from the different perspectives. As the professor mentioned at the beginning of class, this was one of the first times I have had a discussion in a Computer Science course at NYU where I was asked my personal thoughts. My favorite lesson from the discussion was about how scratching a personal itch can be one of the best ways to go about a project. A lot of my personal side projects, even if it is not coding related, begin from a problem that I either face or know about from those around me.

# Stand Up Reflection

It was very interesting to hear from all the other groups and see what kind of work they are focusing on. I think it also showed that our group was on the right track but need to start accelerating the amount of coding contributions being made. There is a specific feature MAPLE wants us to focus on though, so I think our later start does make sense based on that.
